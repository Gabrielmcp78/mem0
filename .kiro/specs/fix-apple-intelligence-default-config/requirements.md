# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FoundationModels Local Memory System currently has a configuration issue where it defaults to OpenAI providers instead of FoundationModels Foundation Models, even when FoundationModels is available and properly configured. This spec addresses fixing the default configuration to prioritize FoundationModels when available, ensuring local processing and privacy by default.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Default Provider Priority

**User Story:** As a user with FoundationModels available, I want the memory system to automatically use FoundationModels Foundation Models by default, so that I get local processing and privacy without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FoundationModels Foundation Models are available THEN the system SHALL use FoundationModels as the default LLM provider
2. WHEN FoundationModels Foundation Models are available THEN the system SHALL use FoundationModels as the default embedding provider
3. WHEN FoundationModels is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to configured alternative providers
4. WHEN no explicit configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL detect and use the best available local provider first

### Requirement 2: Configuration Override System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to override the default FoundationModels configuration when needed, so that I can use alternative providers for testing or specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN explicit provider configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use the specified providers regardless of FoundationModels availability
2. WHEN environment variables specify alternative providers THEN the system SHALL respect those settings
3. WHEN a configuration file specifies providers THEN the system SHALL use those instead of defaults
4. IF explicit configuration fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to FoundationModels if available

### Requirement 3: Automatic Provider Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect the best available providers on my system, so that I don't need to manually configure anything for optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL check FoundationModels availability first
2. WHEN FoundationModels is available THEN it SHALL be marked as the preferred provider
3. WHEN multiple providers are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize local providers over cloud providers
4. WHEN provider availability changes THEN the system SHALL adapt accordingly on next initialization

### Requirement 4: Configuration Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when provider configuration fails, so that I can understand and fix any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FoundationModels initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message explaining the issue
2. WHEN falling back to alternative providers THEN the system SHALL log the fallback reason
3. WHEN no providers are available THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and report specific issues

### Requirement 5: Memory Operations Module Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using the MCP server, I want the memory operations module to use FoundationModels by default, so that all MCP operations benefit from local processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the memory operations module initializes THEN it SHALL use FoundationModels by default if available
2. WHEN MCP server starts THEN it SHALL report which providers are being used
3. WHEN memory operations are called THEN they SHALL use the configured FoundationModels providers
4. WHEN FoundationModels is not available THEN MCP operations SHALL fall back gracefully

### Requirement 6: Environment-Based Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control provider selection through environment variables, so that I can configure the system for different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN APPLE_INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED=true is set THEN the system SHALL prioritize FoundationModels
2. WHEN APPLE_INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED=false is set THEN the system SHALL skip FoundationModels detection
3. WHEN FORCE_PROVIDER environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL use those providers exclusively
4. WHEN no environment configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use intelligent defaults

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current configurations to continue working, so that the fix doesn't break my existing setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing configuration files are present THEN they SHALL continue to work as before
2. WHEN explicit provider configurations are used THEN they SHALL take precedence over new defaults
3. WHEN migration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration guidance
4. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN they SHALL be clearly documented and communicated
