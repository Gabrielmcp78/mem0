# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements FoundationModels Foundation Models integration with the existing mem0 memory system. The system currently has local infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Ollama), MCP servers for Claude Desktop and Kiro IDE, but is using Ollama instead of FoundationModels. This spec covers implementing actual FoundationModels LLM and embedding providers, integrating with macOS Foundation Models framework, and ensuring complete local processing with no external dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want FoundationModels Foundation Models LLM provider implemented in mem0, so that all memory operations use Apple's on-device AI instead of external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing mem0 with FoundationModels provider THEN it SHALL use macOS Foundation Models framework for text generation
2. WHEN processing memory extraction THEN the system SHALL call FoundationModels APIs for fact extraction
3. WHEN generating memory summaries THEN the system SHALL use FoundationModels text generation capabilities
4. WHEN the FoundationModels LLM is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages
5. WHEN using FoundationModels LLM THEN all processing SHALL occur on-device with no external API calls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want FoundationModels Foundation Models embedding provider implemented in mem0, so that all semantic search uses Apple's on-device embeddings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing mem0 with FoundationModels embedder THEN it SHALL use macOS Foundation Models framework for embedding generation
2. WHEN generating embeddings for memory storage THEN the system SHALL call FoundationModels embedding APIs
3. WHEN performing semantic search THEN the system SHALL use FoundationModels embeddings for similarity matching
4. WHEN FoundationModels embeddings are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages
5. WHEN using FoundationModels embeddings THEN all processing SHALL occur on-device with no external API calls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing MCP servers updated to use FoundationModels providers, so that Claude Desktop and Kiro IDE access FoundationModels-powered memory operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP servers initialize THEN they SHALL configure mem0 to use FoundationModels LLM and embedding providers
2. WHEN memory operations are performed through MCP THEN they SHALL use FoundationModels for processing
3. WHEN the system processes memory requests THEN it SHALL use FoundationModels Foundation Models instead of Ollama
4. WHEN MCP operations complete THEN they SHALL return results processed entirely by FoundationModels
5. WHEN FoundationModels is unavailable THEN the MCP servers SHALL provide clear error messages about the dependency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want the system to integrate with Apple's Foundation Models framework, so that I can leverage the Neural Engine and on-device AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL detect and connect to macOS Foundation Models framework
2. WHEN processing text THEN the system SHALL utilize Apple's Neural Engine for optimal performance
3. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use Apple's semantic understanding models
4. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL respect Apple's privacy-first approach with on-device processing
5. WHEN Foundation Models are updated by Apple THEN the system SHALL automatically benefit from improvements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want group chat functionality with multi-agent memory sharing using FoundationModels, so that multiple agents can collaborate with shared context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents participate in a conversation THEN they SHALL access shared memory context processed by FoundationModels
2. WHEN agents generate responses THEN they SHALL incorporate relevant memories using FoundationModels retrieval
3. WHEN conversations involve multiple agents THEN the system SHALL track agent-specific contributions using FoundationModels
4. WHEN new agents join ongoing conversations THEN they SHALL receive FoundationModels-generated context summaries
5. WHEN memory conflicts occur between agents THEN the system SHALL use FoundationModels to resolve inconsistencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with the Chrome extension, I want it to connect to the local FoundationModels memory system, so that web memories are processed with FoundationModels instead of external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Chrome extension initializes THEN it SHALL connect to the local MCP server using FoundationModels
2. WHEN storing web memories THEN the extension SHALL use FoundationModels for processing and embedding generation
3. WHEN searching web memories THEN the extension SHALL query memories processed by FoundationModels
4. WHEN the extension operates THEN it SHALL maintain the same UX while using FoundationModels backend
5. WHEN migrating from managed service THEN existing web memories SHALL be preserved and re-processed with FoundationModels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless migration from the current Ollama-based system to FoundationModels, so that existing functionality continues to work while gaining FoundationModels capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading to FoundationModels THEN existing memory data in Qdrant SHALL be preserved and accessible
2. WHEN using existing mem0 APIs THEN they SHALL transparently use FoundationModels backends instead of Ollama
3. WHEN migrating from Ollama embeddings THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to re-embed existing memories with FoundationModels
4. WHEN running tests THEN all existing MCP functionality SHALL pass with FoundationModels backends
5. WHEN FoundationModels is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want complete transparency that all processing uses FoundationModels locally, so that I can verify no information leaves my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes data THEN it SHALL log all operations confirming FoundationModels local processing
2. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL confirm on-device FoundationModels processing
3. WHEN storing memories THEN the system SHALL indicate FoundationModels was used for processing
4. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL show FoundationModels semantic matching was used
5. WHEN any operation completes THEN the system SHALL verify no external API calls were made and all processing was local
