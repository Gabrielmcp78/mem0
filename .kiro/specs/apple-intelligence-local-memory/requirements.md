# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Apple Intelligence Foundation Models integration with the existing mem0 memory system. The system currently has local infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Ollama), MCP servers for Claude Desktop and Kiro IDE, but is using Ollama instead of Apple Intelligence. This spec covers implementing actual Apple Intelligence LLM and embedding providers, integrating with macOS Foundation Models framework, and ensuring complete local processing with no external dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Apple Intelligence Foundation Models LLM provider implemented in mem0, so that all memory operations use Apple's on-device AI instead of external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing mem0 with Apple Intelligence provider THEN it SHALL use macOS Foundation Models framework for text generation
2. WHEN processing memory extraction THEN the system SHALL call Apple Intelligence APIs for fact extraction
3. WHEN generating memory summaries THEN the system SHALL use Apple Intelligence text generation capabilities
4. WHEN the Apple Intelligence LLM is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages
5. WHEN using Apple Intelligence LLM THEN all processing SHALL occur on-device with no external API calls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Apple Intelligence Foundation Models embedding provider implemented in mem0, so that all semantic search uses Apple's on-device embeddings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing mem0 with Apple Intelligence embedder THEN it SHALL use macOS Foundation Models framework for embedding generation
2. WHEN generating embeddings for memory storage THEN the system SHALL call Apple Intelligence embedding APIs
3. WHEN performing semantic search THEN the system SHALL use Apple Intelligence embeddings for similarity matching
4. WHEN Apple Intelligence embeddings are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages
5. WHEN using Apple Intelligence embeddings THEN all processing SHALL occur on-device with no external API calls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing MCP servers updated to use Apple Intelligence providers, so that Claude Desktop and Kiro IDE access Apple Intelligence-powered memory operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP servers initialize THEN they SHALL configure mem0 to use Apple Intelligence LLM and embedding providers
2. WHEN memory operations are performed through MCP THEN they SHALL use Apple Intelligence for processing
3. WHEN the system processes memory requests THEN it SHALL use Apple Intelligence Foundation Models instead of Ollama
4. WHEN MCP operations complete THEN they SHALL return results processed entirely by Apple Intelligence
5. WHEN Apple Intelligence is unavailable THEN the MCP servers SHALL provide clear error messages about the dependency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want the system to integrate with Apple's Foundation Models framework, so that I can leverage the Neural Engine and on-device AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL detect and connect to macOS Foundation Models framework
2. WHEN processing text THEN the system SHALL utilize Apple's Neural Engine for optimal performance
3. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use Apple's semantic understanding models
4. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL respect Apple's privacy-first approach with on-device processing
5. WHEN Foundation Models are updated by Apple THEN the system SHALL automatically benefit from improvements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want group chat functionality with multi-agent memory sharing using Apple Intelligence, so that multiple agents can collaborate with shared context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents participate in a conversation THEN they SHALL access shared memory context processed by Apple Intelligence
2. WHEN agents generate responses THEN they SHALL incorporate relevant memories using Apple Intelligence retrieval
3. WHEN conversations involve multiple agents THEN the system SHALL track agent-specific contributions using Apple Intelligence
4. WHEN new agents join ongoing conversations THEN they SHALL receive Apple Intelligence-generated context summaries
5. WHEN memory conflicts occur between agents THEN the system SHALL use Apple Intelligence to resolve inconsistencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with the Chrome extension, I want it to connect to the local Apple Intelligence memory system, so that web memories are processed with Apple Intelligence instead of external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Chrome extension initializes THEN it SHALL connect to the local MCP server using Apple Intelligence
2. WHEN storing web memories THEN the extension SHALL use Apple Intelligence for processing and embedding generation
3. WHEN searching web memories THEN the extension SHALL query memories processed by Apple Intelligence
4. WHEN the extension operates THEN it SHALL maintain the same UX while using Apple Intelligence backend
5. WHEN migrating from managed service THEN existing web memories SHALL be preserved and re-processed with Apple Intelligence

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless migration from the current Ollama-based system to Apple Intelligence, so that existing functionality continues to work while gaining Apple Intelligence capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading to Apple Intelligence THEN existing memory data in Qdrant SHALL be preserved and accessible
2. WHEN using existing mem0 APIs THEN they SHALL transparently use Apple Intelligence backends instead of Ollama
3. WHEN migrating from Ollama embeddings THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to re-embed existing memories with Apple Intelligence
4. WHEN running tests THEN all existing MCP functionality SHALL pass with Apple Intelligence backends
5. WHEN Apple Intelligence is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want complete transparency that all processing uses Apple Intelligence locally, so that I can verify no information leaves my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes data THEN it SHALL log all operations confirming Apple Intelligence local processing
2. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL confirm on-device Apple Intelligence processing
3. WHEN storing memories THEN the system SHALL indicate Apple Intelligence was used for processing
4. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL show Apple Intelligence semantic matching was used
5. WHEN any operation completes THEN the system SHALL verify no external API calls were made and all processing was local
