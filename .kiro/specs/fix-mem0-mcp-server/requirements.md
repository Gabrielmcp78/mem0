# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The mem0 MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is currently offline due to a syntax error in the `mem0_enhanced_server.cjs` file. The server is configured in the MCP settings but fails to start because of a truncated or corrupted JavaScript file that contains incomplete function definitions around line 606. This prevents the mem0 memory system from being accessible through the MCP protocol, which is essential for AI assistants to maintain persistent memory across conversations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the mem0 MCP server, I want the server to start successfully without syntax errors, so that I can access mem0 memory functionality through MCP clients like Claude Desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mem0_enhanced_server.cjs file is executed THEN the server SHALL start without syntax errors
2. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL properly initialize all required components including FoundationModels integration
3. WHEN the server is running THEN it SHALL respond to MCP protocol requests correctly
4. WHEN there are missing or incomplete functions THEN they SHALL be properly implemented or removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of AI assistants with MCP integration, I want the mem0 server to provide reliable memory operations, so that my conversations and data are persistently stored and retrievable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory operations are requested THEN the server SHALL execute them successfully
2. WHEN the server encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages and graceful fallbacks
3. WHEN FoundationModels is available THEN the server SHALL use Apple Intelligence for enhanced processing
4. WHEN FoundationModels is unavailable THEN the server SHALL fall back to standard mem0 operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server configuration to be properly validated and documented, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL validate all configuration parameters
2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the server SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
3. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the server SHALL report which dependencies need to be installed
4. WHEN the server is running THEN it SHALL log its operational status and any issues encountered

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the mem0 system, I want the MCP server code to be well-structured and maintainable, so that future updates and bug fixes can be implemented efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the server code THEN it SHALL follow consistent coding patterns and structure
2. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL be complete with proper error handling
3. WHEN the server handles async operations THEN it SHALL properly manage promises and error states
4. WHEN the server integrates with external systems THEN it SHALL include proper connection testing and fallback mechanisms
