Best practices:
- Keep launchd plists as templates with ${REPO_PATH} placeholder. Do not commit machine-specific absolute paths.
- Provide an installer script that substitutes ${REPO_PATH} and installs to ~/Library/LaunchAgents.
- Always set PATH in EnvironmentVariables so Homebrew binaries are available (docker, node, etc.).
- Use /usr/bin/env for ProgramArguments to resolve binaries via PATH.
- Log to /tmp and document log locations.
- Use KeepAlive with SuccessfulExit=false and Crashed=true for resiliency.
