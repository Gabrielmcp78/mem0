## 1. Introduction to Mem0
Mem0 is an open-source memory framework designed to provide AI agents with long-term memory capabilities. It allows agents to store, retrieve, and manage information across various interactions, enhancing their ability to maintain context, learn, and engage in more sophisticated conversations. This guide focuses on setting up a robust local environment to explore all its features.

---

## 2. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your macOS (Apple Silicon M1) system:

*   **Python 3.9+**: Recommended for Mem0. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
*   **pnpm**: For JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies (if you plan to use `mem0-ts` or related components).
*   **Docker Desktop**: Essential for running Qdrant, Neo4j, and Memgraph locally.
*   **Ollama**: For running local LLMs and embedding models.
*   **Git**: For cloning the Mem0 repository.

---

## 3. Core Installation

First, clone the Mem0 repository and install the core dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0.git
cd mem0
pip install -e .
```

This command installs the `mem0` package in editable mode, allowing you to run it directly from the cloned repository.

---

## 4. Local LLM and Embedding Models with Ollama

Mem0 can integrate with local LLMs and embedding models via Ollama. Ensure Ollama is installed and running.

### 4.1 Install Ollama
Download and install Ollama from its official website: <mcurl name="Ollama Official Website" url="https://ollama.ai/"></mcurl>

### 4.2 Pull Models
Pull the desired LLM (e.g., `llama2`) and embedding model (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`).

```bash
ollama pull llama2
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### 4.3 Configure Mem0 to use Ollama
To use Ollama with Mem0, you need to configure your `mem0` instance. You can do this by passing the `llm_config` and `embedder_config` parameters during initialization.

Here's an example of how to initialize `Memory` with Ollama for both LLM and embedding models:

```python:/Volumes/Ready500/DEVELOPMENT/mem0/docs/examples/mem0-with-ollama.mdx
from mem0 import Memory

# Initialize Memory with Ollama for LLM and Embedder
m = Memory(
    llm_config={
        "model": "ollama/llama2",  # Specify Ollama model for LLM
        "api_key": "ollama",  # Ollama doesn't require an API key
        "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1"  # Ollama API base URL
    },
    embedder_config={
        "model": "ollama/nomic-embed-text",  # Specify Ollama model for Embedder
        "api_key": "ollama",
        "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    }
)

# Example usage:
m.add("The capital of France is Paris.")
print(m.search("What is the capital of France?"))
```

This configuration ensures that Mem0 uses your locally running Ollama instance for all language model and embedding operations.

---

## 5. Vector Store with Qdrant

Qdrant is a popular vector database that Mem0 can use for efficient similarity search. We'll run Qdrant using Docker.

### 5.1 Run Qdrant with Docker

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_data:/qdrant/data \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

This command starts a Qdrant container, mapping ports 6333 (HTTP) and 6334 (gRPC) and persisting data to a local `qdrant_data` directory.

### 5.2 Configure Mem0 to use Qdrant

When initializing `Memory`, specify Qdrant in the `vector_store_config`.

```python
from mem0 import Memory

def main():
    m = Memory(
        vector_store_config={
            "provider": "qdrant",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333,
            "api_key": None  # No API key needed for local Qdrant
        }
    )

    # Example usage:
    m.add("My favorite color is blue.")
    print(m.search("What is my favorite color?"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

## 6. Graph Memory with Neo4j/Memgraph

Mem0's Graph Memory feature enhances memory with graph-based knowledge representation. You can use either Neo4j or Memgraph.

### 6.1 Install Graph Dependencies

```bash
pip install "mem0ai[graph]"
```

### 6.2 Option A: Neo4j Setup

#### 6.2.1 Run Neo4j with Docker

```bash
docker run \
    --name neo4j-mem0 \
    -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
    -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \
    neo4j:latest
```

Replace `password` with a strong password. This command exposes the Neo4j browser on `7474` and Bolt protocol on `7687`.

#### 6.2.2 Configure Mem0 with Neo4j

```python
from mem0 import Memory

def main():
    m = Memory(
        graph_store_config={
            "provider": "neo4j",
            "uri": "bolt://localhost:7687",
            "username": "neo4j",
            "password": "password"  # Use the password you set above
        }
    )

    # Example usage for graph memory (requires specific graph operations)
    # To run this, ensure Neo4j is running and you have the graph dependencies installed.
    # m.add("Alice is a friend of Bob.", metadata={"type": "relationship", "subject": "Alice", "predicate": "friend_of", "object": "Bob"})
    # print(m.get_all(collection_name="graph_memory"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 6.3 Option B: Memgraph Setup

#### 6.3.1 Run Memgraph with Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 7687:7687 -p 7474:7474 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph
```

This starts Memgraph and exposes necessary ports.

#### 6.3.2 Configure Mem0 with Memgraph

```python
from mem0 import Memory

def main():
    m = Memory(
        graph_store_config={
            "provider": "memgraph",
            "uri": "bolt://localhost:7687",
            "username": "",  # Memgraph typically doesn't require username/password by default
            "password": ""
        }
    )

    # Example usage for graph memory (similar to Neo4j)
    # To run this, ensure Memgraph is running and you have the graph dependencies installed.
    # m.add("Charlie works at Google.", metadata={"type": "relationship", "subject": "Charlie", "predicate": "works_at", "object": "Google"})
    # print(m.get_all(collection_name="graph_memory"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 7. Asynchronous Operations

Mem0 provides asynchronous clients for non-blocking operations, crucial for high-concurrency applications. You can use `AsyncMemoryClient` for API-based async operations or `AsyncMemory` for in-process async operations.

### 7.1 `AsyncMemoryClient` (for Mem0 API)

To use `AsyncMemoryClient`, you first need to start the Mem0 API server. Navigate to the `mem0` project root and run:

```bash
python -m mem0.server
```

Once the server is running (typically on `http://localhost:1987`), you can use `AsyncMemoryClient` to interact with it asynchronously.

```python:/Volumes/Ready500/DEVELOPMENT/mem0/docs/features/async-client.mdx
import asyncio
from mem0 import AsyncMemoryClient

async def main():
    # Initialize AsyncMemoryClient
    # Replace with your Mem0 API endpoint if different
    mem0_client = AsyncMemoryClient(base_url="http://localhost:1987")

    # Add a memory asynchronously
    memory = await mem0_client.add("The sky is blue.")
    print(f"Added memory: {memory.id}")

    # Search for memories asynchronously
    results = await mem0_client.search("What color is the sky?")
    for res in results:
        print(f"Search result: {res.text}")

    # Get all memories asynchronously
    all_memories = await mem0_client.get_all()
    print(f"Total memories: {len(all_memories)}")

    # Update a memory asynchronously
    if all_memories:
        updated_memory = await mem0_client.update(all_memories[0].id, "The sky is often blue.")
        print(f"Updated memory: {updated_memory.text}")

    # Delete a memory asynchronously
    if all_memories:
        await mem0_client.delete(all_memories[0].id)
        print(f"Deleted memory: {all_memories[0].id}")

    # Get memory history asynchronously
    if all_memories:
        history = await mem0_client.history(all_memories[0].id)
        print(f"Memory history for {all_memories[0].id}: {history}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### 7.2 `AsyncMemory` (in-process)

For in-process asynchronous operations without needing a separate Mem0 server, use `AsyncMemory`.

```python:/Volumes/Ready500/DEVELOPMENT/mem0/docs/features/async-client.mdx
import asyncio
from mem0 import AsyncMemory

async def main():
    # Initialize AsyncMemory (in-process)
    mem = AsyncMemory()

    # Add a memory asynchronously
    memory = await mem.add("The sun is a star.")
    print(f"Added memory: {memory.id}")

    # Search for memories asynchronously
    results = await mem.search("What is the sun?")
    for res in results:
        print(f"Search result: {res.text}")

    # Get all memories asynchronously
    all_memories = await mem.get_all()
    print(f"Total memories: {len(all_memories)}")

    # Update a memory asynchronously
    if all_memories:
        updated_memory = await mem.update(all_memories[0].id, "The sun is a yellow dwarf star.")
        print(f"Updated memory: {updated_memory.text}")

    # Delete a memory asynchronously
    if all_memories:
        await mem.delete(all_memories[0].id)
        print(f"Deleted memory: {all_memories[0].id}")

    # Get memory history asynchronously
    if all_memories:
        history = await mem.history(all_memories[0].id)
        print(f"Memory history for {all_memories[0].id}: {history}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 8. Multi-Agent and Group Chat Capabilities

Mem0 supports multi-user collaboration and multi-agent conversations, allowing agents to share and manage memories in a collaborative environment.

### 8.1 Collaborative Task Agent

Mem0 can be used to build collaborative chat/task management systems where messages are attributed to specific users or agents and can be grouped or sorted.

```python
from mem0 import Memory

def main():
    m = Memory()

    # Add messages with attribution
    m.add("User A: Let's brainstorm ideas for the new marketing campaign.", user_id="user_a", session_id="campaign_brainstorm")
    m.add("User B: I think we should focus on social media engagement.", user_id="user_b", session_id="campaign_brainstorm")
    m.add("User A: Good idea. What platforms should we target?", user_id="user_a", session_id="campaign_brainstorm")

    # Retrieve memories for a specific session
    print("\nMemories for 'campaign_brainstorm' session:")
    for memory in m.get_all(session_id="campaign_brainstorm"):
        print(f"[{memory.metadata.get('user_id', 'N/A')}] {memory.text}")

    # You can also sort or group messages based on metadata for collaborative views.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 8.2 Integration with AutoGen for Multi-Agent Conversations

Mem0 can be integrated with AutoGen to provide agents with persistent memory, allowing them to remember past interactions and context.

First, ensure you have AutoGen installed:

```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

Then, you can define a `Mem0ProxyCoderAgent` (as seen in <mcfile name="mem0-autogen.ipynb" path="/Volumes/Ready500/DEVELOPMENT/mem0/cookbooks/mem0-autogen.ipynb"></mcfile>) or integrate `mem0` directly into your AutoGen agents.

Here's a conceptual example of how `mem0` can be used within an AutoGen conversation (simplified from the notebook):

```python
import autogen
from mem0 import Memory
import os

# Initialize Mem0 instance
mem = Memory()

# Define a custom agent that uses Mem0
class Mem0Agent(autogen.Agent):
    def __init__(self, name, system_message):
        super().__init__(name, system_message=system_message)
        self.mem0 = mem  # Use the shared Mem0 instance

    def receive(self, message, sender, config):
        # Store incoming messages in Mem0
        self.mem0.add(f"Received from {sender.name}: {message}", metadata={"sender": sender.name, "receiver": self.name})
        super().receive(message, sender, config)

    def generate_reply(self, messages, sender, config):
        # Retrieve relevant memories before generating a reply
        # For simplicity, we'll just search for the last message content
        last_message_content = messages[-1]["content"]
        context_memories = self.mem0.search(last_message_content)
        
        # Incorporate context into the reply generation logic
        # This is a simplified example; in a real scenario, you'd integrate this more deeply
        context_str = "\n".join([m.text for m in context_memories])
        
        # Prepare messages for the LLM, including context
        messages_for_llm = messages + [{ "role": "system", "content": f"Context from memory: {context_str}"}]
        
        # Use AutoGen's built-in reply generation, potentially with an LLM
        # This part assumes you have an LLM configured for AutoGen
        reply = super().generate_reply(messages_for_llm, sender, config)
        return reply

# Configure your AutoGen agents
# IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual OpenAI API key or Ollama configuration
# For OpenAI:
# config_list = [
#     {
#         "model": "gpt-4",
#         "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
#     }
# ]

# For Ollama (ensure Ollama is running and models are pulled as per Section 4):
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "llama2", # Or any other Ollama model you have pulled
        "api_key": "ollama",
        "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
    }
]

# Create agents
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="User_Proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER", # Set to "ALWAYS" for interactive chat
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding"}, # Directory for code execution
)

assistant = Mem0Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant that uses memory to provide context-aware responses."
)

# Start the conversation
print("\n--- Starting AutoGen Conversation ---")
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="Tell me about the capital of France. Have we discussed this before?"
)
print("\n--- AutoGen Conversation Ended ---")

# You can inspect the memories added by the agent
print("\nMemories stored by Mem0Agent:")
for memory in mem.get_all():
    print(f"- {memory.text} (Sender: {memory.metadata.get('sender')})")

# Example of escalating to a manager agent (conceptual)
# In a real scenario, this would be triggered by agent logic
# manager_agent = Mem0Agent(
#     name="Manager",
#     system_message="You are a manager agent that handles escalated issues."
# )
# user_proxy.initiate_chat(
#     manager_agent,
#     message="Escalate: The previous assistant could not resolve the query. TERMINATE"
# )
```

This setup allows agents to leverage Mem0 for persistent memory, enabling more complex and context-aware multi-agent interactions.
